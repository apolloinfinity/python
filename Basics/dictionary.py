#Dictionaries are another built in container that stores objects
#They are used to link one object(key) to another object(value)
#This is called mapping and it results in a key-value pair.
#Keys can be used to look up a value but a value cannot be used to look up a key.
#Dictionaries do not store their objects in a specific order like lists or tuples do.
